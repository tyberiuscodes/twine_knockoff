                    <p>This site is the result of a personal challenge project. I wanted a project to work on in order to learn the ropes with Git and version control, but I also needed something that was sufficiently complex enough to actually warrant using Git. I decided to essentially hand-code a Twine game lookalike using only HTML and CSS (no frameworks), limited to a single page. This isn't meant as a novel idea but was instead inspired by the limitations of petsites such as <a href="https://subeta.net/">Subeta</a>, where users have the freedom to customize the individual pages of their "pets" using HTML and CSS. The community has always been extremely creative, but I was especially inspired by the pages of user <a href="https://subeta.net/users/Tashamon">Tashamon</a> (particularly their pets <a href="https://subeta.net/petinfo.php?petid=5936283">Mirror</a> and <a href="https://subeta.net/petinfo.php?petid=1818862">Signal</a>). If you enjoy this project, then I'd encourage you to give those pages a look.</p>
